The simulator must support both simulation of heterogeneous agents such as fire fighters, victims' behaviors and interface to disaster's environments in the real world. RoboCup- Rescue simulator is a comprehensive urban disaster simulator into which a new disaster simulator or rescue agents can be easily plugged. In this paper, the simulator's specification, based on the Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake, and the simulator's architecture are described.",
