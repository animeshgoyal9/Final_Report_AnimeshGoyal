\begin{thesisabstract}               

Recent advancement in the field of reinforcement learning has been driven on strategic games like Atari games, DOTA 2 and StarCraft where testing the model can be done quickly and in a safe manner. 

This work tries to explore strategic multi-agent games as an environment for deep reinforcement learning research. Large state space analysis and long term planning are one of the core requirements of strategic games in order to build a winning strategy. Building these winning strategies using deep reinforcement learning is a attractive as well as challenging task to work on specially when it incorporates multi-agent training where building the strategy is even more difficult. 

RoboCup Rescue Simulation Competition (RCRS), which is part of the annual RoboCup Competition, is an open source virtual environment that evaluates how effective multiple agents like ambulance team, police officer and fire brigades are in rescuing civilians and extinguishing fire from a city where an earthquake just happened. RCRS is challenging, easy to use and customize multi-agent scenario. 

In order to create RCRS environment where reinforcement learning algorithms can be tested, RCRS-gym, an open-source OpenAI Gym environment was created. We tested various algorithms for different map settings. 

Using Deep Q-Network and Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, two agents (fire brigades) were able to learn how to extinguish fire in a city with 37 buildings (Small Map). The agents were able to understand the buildings where fire should be first extinguished so that it doesn't spread to other parts of the city quickly. This proves that the environment is suitable for developing a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning model. Another map having 100 buildings was trained using four fire brigades but required more training time and better hyperparameter tuning to make conclusions on the final performance.

\chapter{Introduction}            




On April 2019, OpenAI's DOTA 2 beat 99.4 percent of players in public matches \cite{dota2}. On October 2019, DeepMind's StarCraft II AI was able to play better than 99.8 percent of all humans \cite{Starcraft2}. These are milestone achievements where artificial intelligence has been used in the area of Multi Agent Systems (MAS). Although different techniques and algorithms were used in the above scenarios, in general, they are all a combination of techniques from two main areas: Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning. 

Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning where agents learn what actions to take in certain environment that results in higher cumulative reward over time. However, one of the drawbacks of RL is that the state space or action space can become too large to be completely known. This is where neural networks can be particularly useful as they are very good function approximators. Neural Networks can learn to map states to values, or state-action pairs to Q values. Rather than building a lookup table to store, index and update all possible states and their values, we can train a neural network on samples from the state or action space to learn to predict how valuable those are relative to our target in reinforcement learning. This is called Deep Reinforcement learning (DRL). 

\begin{figure}[!h]

    \includegraphics[width=12cm]{10.png}
    \caption{\textbf{RoboCup Rescue Simulation Environment:} RoboCup Rescue Simulator provides a 2D reinforcement learning environment where agents can be trained to save civilians and extinguish fire in a city where an earthquake has taken place}
    \label{fig:x}
\end{figure}

Together MAS and DRL are referred to as Multiagent Deep Reinforcement learning (MADRL). Currently, most of the work done in MADRL has been done in the field of video games (e.g. Atari games) and there is still a lot of work to be done for more realistic applications with complex dynamics, which are not necessarily vision based. 

One such domain is RoboCup Rescue Simulator (RCRS) (Figure 1.1). RCRS is structured as a 2D discrete-time simulation system that depicts the situation after occurrence of earthquake in an urban area. Different agents like police officers, fire brigades and ambulance teams interact with the environment and with each other to accomplish tasks such as removing blockades, extinguishing fire and rescuing civilians. This task allocation can be handles in two ways: centralized or distributed. In centralized task allocation, a central agent manages all the agents and has the global knowledge whereas in case of distributed task allocation problem, each agent makes its own decisions and works only on its local information \cite{Nair}. 

\textbf{Contributions:} In this report, using centralized task allocation approach we have applied Deep Reinforcement learning algorithms to RCRS in order to train multiple fire brigades to extinguish the fire in the city on different sized maps having different number of total buildings. We compare a small map having 37 buildings and 2 fire brigades with a bigger map having 100 buildings and 4 fire brigades. The Deep Reinforcement learning techniques applied were Deep Q-learning (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Using DQN, \cite{mnih} was able to achieve human level performance on Atari games whereas PPO helped OpenAI's DOTA 2 team beat 99.4 percent of players in public match. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Built a RCRS-Gym interface, that can be utilized to apply various reinforcement learning algorithms to RCRS}
    \item \textbf{Evaluated state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms on RCRS, providing an extensive set of results for comparison}
    \item \textbf{Showcased promising future research directions in this environment i.e. partial observability and including police officer and ambulance as the agent}
\end{itemize}

The rest of the report is structured as follows. In section 2, previous work that is done in Reinforcement learning and RCRS has been elaborated. Detailed information about RCRS and under what setting did we perform the tests are explained in section 3. In section 4, the result of our proposed method is discussed; and finally in section 5, we arrive at conclusion and discuss directions for future work.


\chapter{Background and Related Work}                       

This section provides a broad outline of research related to our work. Section 2.1 details work on Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement learning. Section 2.2 discusses application of Reinforcement learning to RCRS so far. 

\section{Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement learning (MADRL)}

MADRL has been applied to numerous applications in the real world. One of the earliest MADRL work was done by Tampuu et al \cite{Tampuu}. They had two independent DQN learning agents to play the Atari Pong game. They focused on building a reward function which resulted in either cooperative or competitive behaviours. Leibo et al. \cite{Leibo} studied about independent DQNs in the context of sequential social dilemmas which is a Markov game that satisfies certain inequalities. Their work focused on highlighting that cooperative or competitive behaviors exist not only as discrete actions but they are temporally extended over policies. Lerer and Peysakhovich \cite{Lerer} were able to show theoretically and experimentally that agents can maintain cooperation using the famous Tit-for-Tat strategy for DRL (using function approximators). They used self play and two reward schemes: selfish and cooperative to construct the agents. Bansal et al. \cite{Bansal} used MuJoCo simulator to explore the emergent behaviors in competitive scenarios. They trained independent learning agents with PPO and incorporated two main modifications to deal with the Multiagent nature of the problem. Raghu et al. \cite{Raghu} studied how DRL algorithms like DQN, PPO performed in a two-player zero-sum games with tunable complexity called Erdos-Selfridge Spencer games. They were able to show that algorihms can exhibit wide variation in performance as the algorithms are tuned to the game's difficulty. Jiang and Lu \cite{Jiang} proposed a novel MADRL model that learns to communicate and exchange information while making decisions using actor-critic algorithm. Another interesting work in the field of MADRL was by Shao et al. \cite{Shao} for the game of StarCraft. In order to balance the units moved and attack strength of the enemy, they used parameter sharing multi-agent gradient descent SARSA algorithm using neural network to approximate the value function and reward function. However, high computation power was required for the implementation. 

\section{Reinforcement learning for RCRS}

Martinez et. al \cite{Martinez} were the first one to implement Reinforcement Learning to RCRS. They introduced evolutionary reinforcement learning to improve the ambulance decisions such as deciding the number of ambulances required to rescue a buried civilian. Their trained agent was able to outperform the participants of 2004 RCRS competition. Visser et. al \cite{Visser2018RoboCupRS} developed a new framework to incorporate state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms into RoboCup Rescue competition code using the MATLAB Engine API for Java. Abdolmaleki et. al \cite{abdolmaleki} used SARSA to train the agent. They also proposed lesson-by-lesson learning which solved the problem of huge search space. Their proposed model increased the speed of learning and utilized very low memory. Bitaghsir et. al \cite{Bitaghsir} introduced a layered neuro-fuzzy paradigm which is inspired from incremental learning. The paradigm was used for developing intelligent firefighter robots which involved layering
increasingly complex learned behaviors. Aghazadeh et. al \cite{Aghazadeh} used parametric reinforcement learning to improve police force's decision making in RCRS. Using linear function approximator, they were able to perform the tasks using very less space. 

The work done till now has been quite intriguing but none of it involved MADRL to train the agents. This is what inspired us to write this report. Here, we apply two MADRL algorithms namely DQN \cite{Asghari} and PPO \cite{Schulman} to RCRS and see how they help the fire brigades to finish their task in a quicker manner.


\chapter{Application of Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement learning to RCRS}

\section{Deep Reinforcement learning}

In order to maximize the long term reward signal, Reinforcement learning learns optimal actions for specific environment conditions by trial-and-error \cite{Barto}. 

At each time step t, the agent perceives a state $s_t$ in state space S from which it selects an action $a_t$ in the action space A by following a policy $\pi$. The agent receives a reward $r_t$ when it transitions to the state $s_{t+1}$ according to the environment dynamics, the reward function R($s_t$, $a_t$, $s_{t+1}$) and the transition function T($s_t$, $a_t$, $s_{t+1}$). Discount factor $\gamma$ $\in$ [0, 1] is applied to the future rewards. 

There are two types of RL approach: model based and model free. Model based approach uses a reduced number of interactions with the real environment during the learning phase. Its aim is to construct a model based on these interactions, and then use this model to simulate the further episodes, not in the real environment but by applying them to the constructed model and get the results returned by that model whereas model free based approach act in real environment in order to learn. The most common model-free technique is Q-Learning, where RL agents learn Q-values which are functions of state-action
pair that returns a real value: Q: S $\times$ A $\rightarrow$ R. Thus, the policy is represented as: 

\[ \pi(s) =  \operatorname*{arg\,max}_{a \in A} Q(s,a) \]
 
 where the Q-value can be learned by using Q-learning updates \cite{Q-Learning}:
 
\[ Q(s,a) = (1- \alpha ) Q(s,a) + \alpha[R(s,a) +   {max}_{\alpha \in A} Q(s^{'} , a^{'})] \]

where 0 $\textless$ $\alpha$ $\leq$ 1 is a learning rate. 

In situations where there is large state and action space, it is not feasible to learn the Q-values for each state and action pair. This is when Deep Reinforcement learning (DRL) is used where neural networks are utilized to model the components of RL. The other common model free technique is policy gradient methods which depend upon optimizing parameterized policies with respect to the expected return (long-term cumulative reward) by gradient descent.They do not suffer from problems like lack of guarantee of a value function, the the intractability problem resulting from uncertain state information and the complexity arising from continuous states and actions. We consider two DRL model free based algorithms: Deep Q-Learning and Proximal Policy Optimization \\
\hfill \break 
\textbf{Deep Q-Networks(DQN)}: DQN is a combination of Q-Learning and deep neural networks. DQN addresses the instabilities caused by using non-linear approximator to represent the Q-value by using two insights: experience replay and target network. 
Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) , DQN parameterizes an approximate value function Q(s, a; $\theta_i$) where $\theta_i$ are the weights of the network at iteration i. The experience replay stores the agentâ€™s experiences $e_t$ = ($s_t$, $a_t$, $r_t$, $s_{t+1}$) at each time step t in a dataset $D_t$ = $e_1$,$e_t$ pooled over many episodes into a replay
memory. Then, mini batches of experience drawn uniformly at random from the dataset (s, a, r, s) $\sim$ U(D) are applied as Q-updates during the training. The
Q-learning update at iteration i follows the loss function:

\[ L_i (\theta_i) = E_{(s,a,r,s) \sim U(D) } [(r +  \gamma max_{a^{'}} Q(s^{'}, a^{'} ; \theta_i^{-}) - Q(s,a; \theta_{i}))^2] \]

\hfill \break
where $\theta_i$ are the Q-network parameters at iteration i and $\theta_i^{-}$  are the target network parameters. The target network parameters are updated with the Q network parameters every C steps and are held fixed between individual updates. \\

\hfill \break
\textbf{Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO):} PPO is a type of policy gradient method which performs  comparably or better than state-of-the-art approaches while being much simpler to implement and tune. Careful tuning of the step size is required for achieving good results with policy gradient algorithms \cite{PPO}. Moreover, most policy gradient methods perform one gradient update per sampled trajectory and have high sample complexity. Schulman et al. \cite{Schulman} introduced PPO algorithm that solves both these problems. It uses a surrogate objective which is maximized while penalizing large changes to the policy. 
They defined a likelihood ratio 

\[ l_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t | s_t)}{\pi_{\theta old}(a_t | s_t)}\]

\hfill \break
PPO then optimizes the objective: 

\[ L^{CLIP} = \hat{E}_t [min(l_t(\theta) \hat{A}_t, clip(l_t (\theta) , 1- \epsilon , 1+\epsilon)\hat{A}_t)] \]

\hfill \break
where $\hat{A}_t$ is the generalized advantage estimate and $clip(l_t (\theta) , 1- \epsilon , 1+\epsilon)$ clips $l_t(\theta)$ in the interval [1 - $\epsilon$, 1 + $\epsilon$]. The algorithm alternates between sampling multiple trajectories from the policy and performing several epochs of SGD on the
sampled dataset to optimize this surrogate objective. Since the state value function is also simultaneously approximated, the error for the value function approximation is also added to the surrogate
objective to compute the complete objective function. 

\section{Domain Description}

The competition is based on a complex simulation platform representing a city after a disaster. In order to make the simulator as realistic as possible, its designed to have heterogeneous agents (different types of agent), limited reach (agents can only perform tasks occurring close to them), random fire spread, injured victims, agents having limited communication with messages often getting dropped, agents being only able to see a short distance. It is therefore considered as a multiagent simulator \cite{Kitano}.  

RCRS has 3 major parts: Environment, Agents and Line of Sight:

\subsection{Environment}

The environment in RCRS comprises of various kinds of entities. The most important are buildings, roads, blockages, refuges and humans \cite{Morimoto}. 


\textbf{Buildings} are real constructions and have properties like area, fieryness and temperature, if its made of wood or cement. This information is useful for the simulator to calculate fire spread and building collapses. In case the building area is high and made of wood, fire will spread quickly. Simulator also changes the color of the building depending on the temperature and fieryness value. In case the both the properties are high, color gets darker and eventually turning black if the building is burned out. Note that fieryness value means how strong the fire is. 

\textbf{Roads} help the agents to move along the map. Some of the properties of roads are length, number of lanes. If a road is blocked due to agents standing in front or blockages, its not possible to move along it. 

\textbf{Blockages} is the property of blocking the lanes which usually occurs because of debris falling on the roads after earthquake. This prohibits agents to move forward. The only agent that can clear these blockages is police officers. They have a property of repair cost which lets the police officer know how difficult it is to clear them. 

\textbf{Refuge} are buildings where Fire Brigades can refill their water tanks and civilians can be kept safely. These buildings do not catch fire or collapse. 

\subsection{Agents} There are 3 kinds of agents in RCRS. 

\textbf{Fire Brigades} These agents are responsible for extinguishing fires in the buildings. They have water tanks with certain water capacity that needs to refilled from the refuge. Fire Brigades also have health points that decreases in case they catch fire or enter a building on fire. In case there health points drops to zero, they are considered dead. 

\textbf{Ambulance Teams} These agents are responsible for rescuing the injured civilians and carrying them safely to the refuge. They also have health points that decreases in case they catch fire. They cannot carry more than one victim at a time. 

\textbf{Police Officers} These agents are responsible to clear the blockages and allow other agents to complete their tasks. To clear a blockage, police officers need to get close to it. 

\subsection{Line of Sight} Each agent has a particular line of sight beyond which they cannot see. Since at each timestep, agents are able to visualize only a set of entities.

\hfill

In this report, we have focused on training multiple fire brigades to extinguish the fire as quickly as possible. Figure 3.1 gives a visual representation of how the simulator looks. 

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=12cm]{13}
    \caption{\textbf{Representation of the Simulator:} RoboCup Rescue Simulator with fire brigades. Different polygons are the buildings in the map. Grey color shows building is unburnt, yellow and red color shows building is burning, blue color depicts fire is extinguished and black shows the building is totally burnt. Note that as the shades get darker, building temperature and fieryness (degree of fire) increases.}
    \label{fig:x}
\end{figure}

%---------------------------Put this in gym section ---------------------------------------------
In order to train the agents, we have taken help of Open AI's Gym toolkit \cite{brockman2016openai} which has been used to develop and compare different reinforcement learning algorithms. Reinforcement learning requires an agent and an environment. Environment, that represents the outside world to the agent and an agent that takes actions, receives observations from the environment which consists of a reward for the actions taken and knowledge of the new state. That reward implies how good or bad the action was, and the observation implies what will be the next state in the environment. Figure 3.2 explains how this loop is implemented to RCRS. 
%---------------------------Put this in gym section ---------------------------------------------

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=14cm]{23}
    \caption{The neural network takes in state information and the reward collected at every timestep from the environment. State information contains (X,Y) coordinates, water level, health of the all the agents and temperature, fieryness of the buildings present. The neural network processes this information and outputs a building ID where the fire brigade needs to move next}
    \label{fig:x}
\end{figure}

Fire is initiated randomly following a Poisson distribution on the map. Fire brigades start searching the map looking for fire spots in the environment. Once the fire trucks detect a fire, they start extinguishing it. Note that extinguishing only takes place if the fire trucks are in a close proximity to the building. Fire brigades extinguish the fire until one of the three conditions hold true: (i) It is able to extinguish the fire completely, (ii) building has been completely burned out, or (iii) water in the fire tank is empty. For the first two situations, fire brigades start searching for a new building. For the third case, fire brigades move to the refuge to refill their tanks. In case the fire brigade sees more than one building on fire, it selects the one with highest priority using the following equation: 

\[ Priority = (\frac{Fieryness}{Total Area}) + (\frac{1}{\sqrt{distance}}) + {UnBurnedNeighbors}  \]

By this formula, priority is given to the building which has the highest fieryness, nearby and has the most number of neighbors.

Pseudo code for the algorithm that fire brigade follows is described in Pseudo-Algorithm 1.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Fire Brigade}
\begin{algorithmic}

\IF {(agent is inside refuge) and (water capacity of the fire truck is not full)}
\STATE  Refill the tank
\ENDIF 
\IF {(agent is stuck in blockage) or (building is not reachable)}
\STATE Search for buildings
\ENDIF
\IF {Water tank gets empty}
\STATE Start moving to the refuge
\ENDIF
\IF {(agent has not target)}
\IF {(agent sees a fire)}
\STATE Select target
\ELSIF {(communication is enabled)}
\STATE Request target
\ELSE 
\STATE  Search for buildings 
\ENDIF 
\ENDIF
\IF {(Target is not visible)}
\STATE Start moving towards the target
\ENDIF
\IF {(Target is visible)}
\STATE Extinguish fire
\ENDIF
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


%---------------------------Put this in gym section ---------------------------------------------
At the starting of the simulation, a random building ID is provided to the Fire Brigade. After reaching its destination, the state information and the reward value is calculated and fed to the neural network which then outputs a vector of length equal to the number of building ID's. This vector is then passed through a softmax layer and then an Argmax layer which eventually gives the ID of the building to be visited next by our agent. 

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Defining State Space, Action Space and Reward function}

The first step in applying reinforcement learning algorithms involves defining state space, action space and reward function. 

\subsection{State Space}
    
State space has three parts. The first part is the building information which consists of the temperature and fieryness. Note that, fieryness is a parameter to measure the degree of fire in a building. The second part is the agent information which gives the location ((X,Y) coordinates), water in the fire tanks and the health points of the fire brigade at each timestep. The third part is the busy/idle information which is a binary variable. Fire brigades receive a building id at each timestep as their target location. But it sometimes takes more than one timestep for them to reach the building. In the meanwhile, actions are being sent continuously. Hence, fire brigades have to ignore the actions till the time they visit the building they have been told to visit in the previous timestep. This information is passed over as a state information which will be highly valuable for our algorithm to perform better. Whenever the actions that are sent by the algorithm are used in the simulator (busy), 1 is sent back as the state information otherwise 0 is sent (idle). All the other state information values have certain ranges which are elaborated in Table 1.

    \begin{tabular}{ l|l|l } 
    \hline
    State & Parameter & Range \\
    \hline \hline
    \multirow Building Information & Temperature of Building  & 0-100 \\ 
    & Fieryness of Building  & 0-10 \\ 
    
    \multirow Agent Information & (X, Y) Coordinates & 0-10000 \\ 
    & Water Level  & 0-15000 \\ 
    & Health Points & 0-10000 \\

\subsection{Action Space} 
    
The only action available to our agent is to move to the building which is on fire and therefore the action space consists of the ID's of the buildings. Note that extinguishing fire and refilling water are default characteristics of our agent i.e. whenever our agent is near a building on fire, it will try to extinguish it and whenever it is out of water, it will move to the refuge to refill the tank. Therefore these actions are not included in the action space. Detailed information about how the actions are performed as described in section 4.
    
\subsection{Reward Function}
        
Since the ultimate goal of the fire brigades is to extinguish fire as quickly as possible, we created a reward function that awards the agents higher rewards for keeping the fire to a minimum and penalize them if the fire increases. Fieryness is one parameter that measures the degree of burn in the building and hence keeping the overall fieryness value to a minimum results in a higher cumulative reward. 
    
\begin{table} [!h]
\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{l | l} 
 \hline
 Fieryness Value & Reward Value  \\ [0.5ex] 
 \hline\hline
 0-2 & +10 \\
 3-5 & -5\\
 6-10 & -10  \\

\section{Model Architecture}

We use DQN and PPO architecture with a few modifications. We do not have the set of convolutional layers since the input to the neural networks is not an image. The input to the network is state representation and there is a separate output unit for each possible action. Different architectures were used for small map and big map which are mentioned in the following sections. 

\subsection{Model Architecture for Small Map} The 3 layer neural network consists of two fully connected (FC) layers having 64 units each (Figure 3). It is followed by a softmax layer. The output layer is a fully connected linear layer with single output for each possible action. Every agent has its own neural network copy in order to allow it to learn its own local policy since every agent is trained independently. Note that environment here is fully observable.

    \caption{\textbf{Schematic Illustration of the Neural Network:} The input to the neural network is the state information which consists of a vector of length 94 having agent 1's current (X, Y) coordinates, water level, health, agent 2's current location, temperature, fieryness of the buildings and busy/idle condition. This is followed by 2 fully connected layers and a softmax and argmax layers to finally give a single action for the agent. The same architecture is used for second fire brigade also}

\chapter{Evaluation and Results}
\section{Integration of Gym to RCRS}

Most of the Reinforcement learning algorithms are written in python. Since our aim is to build a simulator that is not only useful for our research work but can be used for future research by the community as well, we decided to integrate RCRS with gym that provides at easy-to-use suite of reinforcement learning tasks \cite{brockman2016openai}. Below is an example code that will run a random agent in our environment:
\begin{lstlisting}

import RCRS_gym
import gym

env = gym.make('RCRS-v2')
env.reset()
done = False
while not done:
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    obs, rew, done, info = env.step(action)

\end{lstlisting}

\section{Small Map}

As mentioned in the Introduction section, we are comparing two maps having different number of buildings and fire brigades. The first map is having 37 buildings and 2 fire brigades. The results of running PPO, DQN is shown in the figure.
